Code for reproducing the ACL 2022 paper: Tackling Fake News Detection by Continually Improving Social Context Representations using Graph Neural Networks

There are three folders, each with a README: "Code", "Dataset_Release" and "News-Media-Reliability-Master". Code contains the code to build the graph, train it on Node Classification, and run Inference Operators. Dataset_release contains the data that we collected (some of it is hosted on Google Drive and the links are provided).
